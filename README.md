## 👋 About Me
I’m a passionate Flutter developer who believes that *“everything we can imagine is real.”* From sketching digital art to prototyping my first mobile app at Cairo University, I’ve always been driven by curiosity, creativity, and a hands‑on approach to learning. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring Cairo’s art scene, experimenting with fusion recipes in my kitchen, or diving into the latest AI and tech blogs.
